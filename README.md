# Data-Science-Lab-Project

What was the impact of Covid-19 on energy consumption
of the University of Milan-Bicocca?
Through an accurate analysis of the data of the
buildings U1 and U6 this elaborate sets the goal
to provide an overview of how the two waves of
pandemics have had an impact on consumption, in order
to suggest, as far as possible, strategies that
allow to optimize power management
absorbed. An interactive tool will also be built
that can allow the monitoring of
changes in consumption, identifying specific ones
estimates that make it possible to identify the corresponding economic cost and the CO2 footprint released by
buildings.
